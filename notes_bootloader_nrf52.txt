1. Upload the bootloader

- Bootloader on Git: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader

- Useful Link: https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-the-nrf52/nrf52840-bootloader
	A. Instructions for Windows. Problem with compling the bootloader. GCC errors! One could also just no compline the source code and just 	upload the .hex file? Not sure. Confirm!
	B. Uses nrfjprog which is a helper program to talk to JLink devices like the nrf52840 DK we ordered or Segger JLink device
